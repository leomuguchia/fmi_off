# fmi_off

Created for use for a larger iDevice management project but this script is open for use and modifications
I chose not to automate the email verification process to allow the user to receive updates on progress of FMI Off from Apple

Requirements:
    Chrome webdriver
    Selenium
   

Usage:
    Install the dependencies required in the import statements
    You need the IMEI number of your idevice
    Head to https://al-support.apple.com/#/additional-support and get the Apple confirmation link
    The link should be sent to your email after verifying your email
    Run the script and paste the confirmation email
    After successfully submitting the details, the script runs a background check after every 30 minutes,
    To fetch your case ID progress
    Have fun @user!!
